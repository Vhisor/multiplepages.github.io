          lot of hands on training modules and takes care of how different methods are applied practically. recently got challenged to host one of our freeCodeCamp projects on a free web hosting site. it was quite challenging as it was supposed to be especially when you try to use those hosting platforms that won't handle most of the difficulties in hosting on your behalf. I used github and because i signed up for github earlier and I understand the interface a little bit, i was able to follow prompts to get my file hosted. what surprised me was when a i had to help a friend host his and we were getting error 404 that says the page was not found... we tried everything we thought could be the problem but couldn't solve i...  we had use the platform on the pc and that worked out fine and i still don't understand why it didn't work out on the mobile <br>
